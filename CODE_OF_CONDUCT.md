# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* **Being respectful**: Treating all community members with respect and kindness
* **Being inclusive**: Welcoming newcomers and helping them feel at home
* **Being collaborative**: Working together constructively towards common goals
* **Being professional**: Maintaining a professional tone in all interactions
* **Being constructive**: Providing helpful and actionable feedback
* **Being patient**: Understanding that people have different levels of experience
* **Being empathetic**: Showing understanding towards other community members' perspectives

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Spamming issues or discussions with irrelevant content
* Deliberately derailing conversations or discussions
* Impersonating other community members or maintainers

## Community-Specific Guidelines

As a community focused on certification exam preparation and educational content, we also expect:

### Respectful Learning Environment
* **Support learners at all levels**: Whether someone is new to certifications or an experienced professional
* **Share knowledge generously**: Help others learn and grow in their certification journey
* **Avoid gatekeeping**: Don't make others feel unwelcome based on their current knowledge level
* **Be encouraging**: Certification exams can be challenging - support and encourage fellow learners

### Content and Contribution Guidelines
* **Respect intellectual property**: Only share content that you have the right to share
* **Be accurate**: Ensure information about exams and certifications is correct and up-to-date
* **Stay relevant**: Keep discussions focused on the Exams-Viewer project and related topics
* **Quality contributions**: Strive to make meaningful contributions to discussions and issues

### Professional Standards
* **Industry professionalism**: Maintain the same professional standards you would in a workplace
* **Constructive feedback**: When discussing features or reporting bugs, focus on the issue, not the person
* **Collaborative problem-solving**: Work together to find solutions rather than just pointing out problems

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders and maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This includes:
* GitHub repository interactions (issues, pull requests, discussions)
* Comments on any platforms where the project is discussed
* Direct messages between community members about project matters
* Any public forums where you identify yourself as a member of this community

## Reporting Guidelines

### How to Report

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by:

1. **Creating a private issue**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
2. **Contacting maintainers directly**: Reach out to project maintainers via their GitHub profiles
3. **Email reporting**: Send detailed reports to project maintainers (contact information will be provided in repository settings)

### What to Include in Reports

When reporting incidents, please include:

* **Description of the incident**: What happened and when
* **Involved parties**: Who was involved (usernames, if known)
* **Evidence**: Screenshots, links, or other supporting evidence
* **Impact**: How the incident affected you or others
* **Preferred resolution**: What outcome you're hoping for

### Confidentiality

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you may appeal the decision by:

1. Contacting the community leaders with a detailed explanation
2. Providing additional context or evidence
3. Requesting a review of the decision

Appeals will be reviewed by multiple community leaders when possible.

## Recognition of Good Behavior
